# Unit III: Modeling the Average Response as a Function of a Continuous Predictor {-}

Unit I explored the language and logic of statistical inference, and Unit II applied those concepts toward making inference on the mean response of a single variable.  Within this context, we developed the idea of a statistical model for the data generating process, and introduced the concept of a standardized statistic.  We now refine these ideas as we introduce the use of predictors in the data generating process.  Specifically, we model the average response as a linear function of a single predictor.
