"1","## Regression Sum of Squares
The Regression Sum of Squares, abbreviated SSR, is given by

$$SSR = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[(\text{Predicted Mean Response})_i - (\text{Overall Mean Response})\right]^2$$

where the predicted mean response is computed using the least squares estimates and the overall mean response is the sample mean.

This is also known as the Treatment Sum of Squares in ANOVA."
