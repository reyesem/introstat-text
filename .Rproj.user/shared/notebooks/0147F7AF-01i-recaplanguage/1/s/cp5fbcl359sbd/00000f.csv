"0","#| fig-cap: Model of the null distribution for the relative risk comparing volunteers assigned to clean wildlife to volunteers assigned to tasks not involving oil exposure.  The null hypothesis assumed the two groups of volunteers had the same risk.  The null distribution was developed via bootstrapping using 50000 replications."
