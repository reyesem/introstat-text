## Models for the Data Generating Process
This text takes a modeling approach to inference.  The following models are introduced in the text; each model is presented with a link to where the model was fully defined in the text.

## Data Generating Process for Single Mean Response (@eq-single-mean)
In general, given a quantitative response variable and no predictors, our model for the data generating process is

$$(\text{Response})_i = \mu + \epsilon_i$$
  
where $\mu$ represents the average response in the population, the parameter of interest.

## Simple Linear Regression Model (@eq-slr)
For a quantitative response and a quantitative predictor, the general form of the simple linear regression model is

$$(\text{Response})_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\text{Predictor})_i + \varepsilon_i$$

where $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are parameters governing the model for the data generating process.

## General Linear Regression Model (@eq-mlr)
For a quantitative response and one or more predictors, the general form of the linear regression model is

$$
\begin{aligned}
  (\text{Response})_i 
    &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\text{Predictor 1})_i + \beta_2(\text{Predictor 2})_i + \dotsb + \beta_p (\text{Predictor } p)_i + \varepsilon_i \\
    &= \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_j (\text{Predictor j})_i + \varepsilon_i
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\beta_j$ for $j = 0, 1, 2, \dotsc, p$ are the $p + 1$ parameters governing the model for the data generating process.

## ANOVA Model (@eq-anova)
For a quantitative response and a single categorical predictor (also known as a factor) with $k$ levels, the ANOVA model is

$$(\text{Response})_i = \sum_{j = 1}^{k} \mu_j (\text{Group } j)_i + \varepsilon_i$$

where

$$(\text{Group } j)_i = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{i-th unit belongs to group } j \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

is an indicator variable capturing whether a unit belongs to the $j$-th group and $\mu_1, \mu_2, \dotsc, \mu_k$ are the parameters governing the model for the data generating process.

:::{.callout-important}
## Repeated Measures ANOVA Model (@eq-blocks)
For a quantitative response and a single categorical predictor (also known as a factor) with $k$ levels in the presence of $b$ blocks, the repeated measures ANOVA model is

$$(\text{Response})_i = \sum_{j = 1}^{k} \mu_j (\text{Group } j)_i + \sum_{m = 2}^{b} \beta_m (\text{Block } m)_i + \varepsilon_i$$ 

where

$$
\begin{aligned}
  (\text{Group } j)_i 
    &= \begin{cases} 1 & \text{i-th unit belongs to group } j \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \\
  (\text{Block } m)_i 
    &= \begin{cases} 1 & \text{i-th unit belongs to block } m \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$ 

are indicator variables capturing whether a unit belongs to the $j$-th group and $m$-th block, respectively; and, $\mu_1, \mu_2, \dotsc, \mu_k$ and $\beta_2, \beta_3, \dotsc, \beta_b$ are the parameters governing the model for the data generating process.

This model assumes any differences between groups are similar across all blocks.

The following key terms were defined in the text; each term is presented with a link to where the term was first encountered in the text.

```{r}
#| label: create-glossary
#| output: asis

# Create a list of definitions from a QMD file.
determine_terms <- function(x) {
  defns <- repeat_block(x, pattern = ':::\\{#def-')
  
  tibble(
    labels = get_terms(defns, 'reference'),
    terms = get_terms(defns, 'title'),
    defn = str_trim(get_terms(defns, 'text'))
  )

# Obtain definitions from all files
